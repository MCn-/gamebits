========

Fetch game info from the internet. There will be lots of bugs, please submit any issues here or on the forums. Or PM me.

Installation
============

- Download the files from https://github.com/MCn-/gamebits/archive/master.zip
- Put this in a folder somewhere, optionally add it to your path

Usage
========

You can run the script by supplying either a URL to an IGN game page or simply the game name.

    ./gamebits.py <GAME NAME> <CONSOLE> <SOURCE> <LANGUAGE>

or

    ./gamebits.py <IGN URL> <CONSOLE> <SOURCE> <LANGUAGE>
    
Note: CONSOLE should be equal to the one used on IGN, which usually will be fairly similar to what you would expect, but in some cases may be different. For example, the Nintendo 64 has an id of n64, and the Gamecube has an id of gc.
